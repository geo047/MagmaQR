Description: Provides a client-server based interface to the QR factorisation (single-/multi-gpu routines) from the MAGMA library. Can be used as replacement for the qr.Q() function in R. We get the server to check how many GPUs are present therefore we do not need CUDA/other interface to be present for compilation of the MagmaQR package. Required is the MAGMA library available (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/) compiled as position independent code with a multi-threaded high performance LAPACK and -DMAGMA_ILP64 defined (an example make.inc file should be available in MAGMA download package).
