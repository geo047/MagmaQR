GetServerArgs           Initialise shared memory on client and obtain
                        server launch string.
MagmaQR                 MagmaQR - provides a fast replacement for the
                        qr() function, using GPU based MAGMA library
                        routine.
MakeServer              Creates the server executable.
RunServer               Creates the R client side shared memory region
                        and then launches a server process which is
                        given access to the shared region. The server
                        then waits for the R client to give it a matrix
                        on which it will compute the eigenvalue
                        decomposition of useing a syevdx_2stage MAGMA
                        library function.
StopServer              Function signals to the server through shared
                        memory region to terminate from its main loop
                        and then deletes the client CSharedMemory
                        object
qr_mgpu                 Function used to obtain the eigenvalue
                        decomposition (EVD) of a non-symmetric matrix
                        using a MAGMA 2-stage multi-gpu EVD algorithm
